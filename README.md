### *Your Personal AI Learning Guru — Built with Vue 3, Vite, Tailwind, and TypeScript*

Project Dronacharya is an AI-powered learning companion designed to help students structure their study material, generate custom curriculums, summarize content, and practice intelligently. Inspired by the wisdom of Guru Dronacharya, this platform transforms scattered notes into a clear, guided learning path.

This is the **Vue 3 stack refactor** of the earlier React prototype, built with a scalable architecture suitable for future AI integrations (Gemini/OpenAI, embeddings, vector search, flashcard generation, curriculum planner, etc.).

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Vue 3 (Composition API + SFCs)**
* **Vite** for lightning-fast bundling
* **TypeScript** for type safety
* **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling
* **Vue Router** for client-side navigation
* Future integrations:

  * AI-powered note summarization
  * Curriculum generator
  * Practice & spaced-repetition engine
  * Material extraction from PDFs/docs
